# Background

The problem statement for this project is to analyze sales data from a hypothetical store across different product categories and years to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help in making data-driven business decisions. The dataset represents sales transactions and includes information about sales, profits, and product categories over multiple years. The goal is to gain actionable insights from the data to optimize sales strategies, improve profitability, and enhance overall business performance for the hypothetical store.

# Objectives

- Analyze sales data to understand the overall sales trends and performance across different product categories.

- Identify the key factors influencing sales and profitability, such as seasonality, product popularity, pricing strategies, etc.

- Determine the impact of external factors (e.g., economic conditions, market trends) on sales performance.

- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to support decision-making processes within the organization.


# Key Findings

#### Overall Sales Performance: 

YOY sales for all categories have shown steady growth throughout 2020 and 2021, indicating a positive trajectory.

#### WOW Growth Decline: 

A notable decline in WOW growth rates was observed towards the end of 2021 across all categories, suggesting a potential shift in consumer behavior or market conditions.

#### Contribution to Change Analysis: 

Upon analyzing the sales data for the years 2020 and 2021 across distinct product categories—namely, furniture, office supplies, and technology—it was noted that the distribution of contribution to change varied between the two years.

In 2020, the primary driver of the change in sales was observed to be office supplies, followed by furniture and then technology. Conversely, the dynamics shifted in 2021, with furniture emerging as the leading contributor to the change in sales, succeeded by office supplies and technology.

This shift in the relative significance of product categories highlights the evolving landscape of consumer preferences and market dynamics over the observed period.

# Recommendations

#### Diversify Product Offerings:

Given that the maximum contribution to change in both years came from office supplies, furniture, and technology, consider diversifying product offerings within these categories. Introducing new product lines or expanding existing ones can help capture a broader market segment and mitigate risks associated with dependence on specific products.


#### Product Focus: 

Allocate more resources towards promoting high-contributing product categories, such as office supplies, furniture, and technology. This could involve running targeted marketing campaigns, offering special promotions, or bundling related products to encourage upselling.


#### Customer Feedback Analysis: 

Collect and analyze customer feedback to identify pain points and areas for improvement in the shopping experience. Addressing customer concerns promptly can help improve satisfaction and loyalty.

# Conclusion 

In conclusion, analysis of sales data from 2020 and 2021 highlighted a marginal increase in year-over-year sales, with a decline in week-over-week growth towards the end of 2021. Office supplies, furniture, and technology emerged as the primary contributors to sales change, with furniture leading in 2021.

To address these trends, we can focus on category-specific strategies, product assortment optimization, enhanced customer engagement, price optimization, and online presence enhancement. By implementing these solutions, we aim to drive sustainable sales growth and maintain our competitive edge in the market.
